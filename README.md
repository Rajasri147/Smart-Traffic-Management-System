# Smart-Traffic-Management-System
A Smart Traffic Management System using Arduino Uno, ultrasonic sensors, and servo motors to manage a four-lane junction. The project implements a Dynamic Priority Scheduling mechanism to adjust traffic signals and toll gates based on real-time vehicle detection, ensuring efficient traffic flow and reducing congestion.
